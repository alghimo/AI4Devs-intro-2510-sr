# Prompts Documentation

## Original Prompt

**User Request:**
```
Given the two files I am sharing, `index.html` and `script.js`, create a webpage which allows a user to enter a string and returns the reverse version of that string. For instance, if a user enters "AI4Devs", the result should be "sveD4IA", if a user enters "Hello World!", the result should be "!dlroW olleH". The output should contain the updated index.html, script.js, plus a markdown file called "prompts.md" which contains the prompt I used. If any clarification questions are needed, present me with options so that I can choose answers with A / B / C style, and include both the clarification questions and my responses in the prompts.md file as well. The prompts file should only contain the prompts and if clarification questions were needed, the questions and answers too, but nothing else like the reasoning you did.
```

**Clarification Questions:** None needed.

## Follow-up Prompt #1

**User Request:**
```
ok, now I would like to add some logic so that the button is disabled until there are at least 3 characters in the text input. Update the necessary files, and add this prompt to the prompts.md file, after the prompt that is already there. The prompts file should only contain the prompts and if clarification questions were needed, the questions and answers too, but nothing else like the reasoning you did.
```

**Clarification Questions:** None needed.
